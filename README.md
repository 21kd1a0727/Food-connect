This project seeks to tackle the dual challenges of food waste and food insecurity, which frequently affect the same communities. Our approach is to create a streamlined solution that addresses both issues concurrently. We aim to connect local surplus food providers—such as restaurants, grocery stores, and farms—with individuals and families facing food insecurity. By collaborating with these suppliers, we will gather surplus food that remains safe and nutritious, preventing it from going to waste. This food will then be redistributed to those in need, ensuring that more people have access to healthy meals while reducing overall food waste.
